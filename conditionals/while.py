# Another type of conditional is "While"
# Read the following code aloud and see if you can understand it:
# (Remember that "<" is 'Less Than"!)

foo = 1

while (foo < 100):
    print ("Foo is less than 100, it's only %d" % foo)

# ToDo:
# Write some Python code below where foo starts at 100 and counts down to zero
